Here at Faith Bound, we hold to the belief that everyone is sinful. That everyone has done something wrong to rebel against their creator and that the punishment for that sin is death.

That is why God sent his son Jesus, for He so loved creation and yearned to know His people that Jesus died the death that all believers deserved to atone for our sins. And that he arose again three days later, His sacrifice accepted by God on high and now mediates for us to His Father at all times.

And that all who believe this message, would be justified by faith, not by works, and know true joy and peace in their lives as they enter a close relationship with their perfect Father in heaven.
